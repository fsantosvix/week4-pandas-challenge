# Local Government High School Students’ Performance

This analysis summarises the results in Maths and Reading scores from **39,170** students from 15 government and independent high schools in the Local Government Area, with a total budget of $24.6 million.

The average scores from all 39,170 students were:

- Maths: 70.34
- Reading: 69.98

Considering that students must achieve a score of at least **50 points** to pass in each subject, we have the following results:

- 86.08% of students passed Maths
- 84.43% of students passed Reading
- 72.81% of students passed both Maths and Reading

The second table brings a breakdown of the results by school. The top 3 schools that presented the highest Maths average results:

1. Holden High School (72.58)
2. Bailey High School (72.35)
3. Pena High School (72.09)

The best average Reading scores were from:

1. Holden High School (71.66)
2. Pena High School (71.61)
3. Cabrera High School (71.36)

Wright High School had the highest percentage of students passing in Maths (91.78%), while Cabrera High School had the highest in Reading (89.07%).

The third table lists the top-performance schools, considering the overall passing percentage. Griffin High School had the highest percentage of students passing both subjects (81.34%).

On the other hand, the fourth table is about the bottom performance schools. Hernandez High School had the lowest number of students passing both subjects (66.36%).

The fifth table analyses the Maths results from each school by Year of study. Holden High School Year 10 students achieved the highest average score.

The sixth table brings a similar analysis but with the scores from the Reading tests. Again, Holden High School had the best average result, but now with their Year 11 students.

The seventh table compares the results considering the expenditure per student, splitting the schools into four spending ranges. The best results were observed at schools spending _$585 to $630_ per student.

The eighth table splits the schools according to their sizes, while the last table compares the school types (either government or independent).

### Conclusions

From the data available, we can conclude that:

- A higher expenditure per student doesn’t guarantee better results. The schools in the higher expenditure bracket (from $645 to $680 per student) had the lowest results in all metrics.
- Smaller schools have better performance than larger schools. Schools with less than 1000 students presented the best averages and percentage of passing students in all subjects.
- Independent schools outperform Government schools. Even though there is no significant difference in the averages, the percentage of passing students is much higher in Independent schools.
